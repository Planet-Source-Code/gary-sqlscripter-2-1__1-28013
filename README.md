### Description

This is an update to the fantastic work of Jeremy van Dijk on SQLScripter 2.0. I have added just a few minor enhancements by borrowing more great code from Royce D. Powers (SPGenerator). The main feature that I've added is the ability to generate INSERT scripts for a selected set of tables - definitely NOT difficult, but handy. I have also made the command line options more complete and added a few extra.
 
### More Info
 
See the included text file. Uses the MS SQLDMO and DTS library that comes with SQL7 or above.
